# Hello-world

Hello everyone!

1.I'm funny, I laugh even when I'm not supposed to and I often make others smile.
2.I have a great sense of humor. I sometimes embarrass myself but I still make people laugh.
3.I love to  grow.
4. I believe in generally being optimistic about things. Like they say â€˜the glass is half full'? Well, I like to believe it is three-fourths full, and that too with something like iced cold coffee. Know what I mean?

The world has a need for me.
